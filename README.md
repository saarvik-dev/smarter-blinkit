## 📡 External APIs & Services

We leverage a suite of modern APIs to power the "Smarter" features:

1.  **Google Gemini AI (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite` / `gemini-3.0-flash`)**: Orchestrates the Recipe Agent, Intent Search, and Natural Language processing.
2.  **Google Gemini Embeddings (`gemini-embedding-001`)**: Generates 3072-dimensional vector representations for high-precision semantic product pairing.
3.  **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)**: Provides forward and reverse geocoding for detecting user locations and converting typed addresses to coordinates.
4.  **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)**: Solves the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to calculate optimized multi-stop delivery routes between shops and the buyer.
5.  **Indian Postal Pin Code API (`api.postalpincode.in`)**: Automatically maps 6-digit PIN codes to their respective Districts/Cities and States during registration.
6.  **Hugging Face (Inference Fallback)**: Used as a secondary layer for semantic similarity if Gemini quotas are exceeded.
7.  **Stripe API (Test Mode)**: Handles real card payments via Stripe PaymentIntents. Uses `@stripe/stripe-js` (frontend) and `stripe` Node SDK (backend) for a full PCI-compliant checkout flow.
8.  **OpenFoodFacts API**: Public external API used to seamlessly fetch product details (name, brand, category, image) for unrecognised barcodes during inventory scanning, eliminating manual entry.
9.  **Google Images (via `googlethis`)**: Powers the automated background product image scraper to dynamically fetch and attach hyper-accurate, real-world packaging thumbnails for all catalog items without relying on generic placeholders.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Stage 1 — The Foundation ✅
- **Dual Login**: Buyers and Sellers see completely different dashboards after login.
- **Role-based Routing**: Seamless redirection post-login preventing back-button loops.
- **Face ID Login**: Register your face once, then log in just by looking at the camera (face-api.js), now integrated directly into the signup flow.
- **Theme Consistency**: Fully reactive theme architecture using the premium **Market Ledger** styling system (warm cream theme `#F7F3EA` / forest-dark theme `#14231C` with editorial Fraunces display typography, Inter body typography, and monospace IBM Plex Mono totals).
- **Progressive Smart Search**: Google-like live search — results update as you type. Typing `V` instantly returns Vicks, Vitamins, Vegetables etc. No need to type the full keyword.

### Stage 2 — The Automator ✅
- **Meal Planner (AI Recipe Agent)**: Type "Make pizza for 4 people" → Gemini extracts ingredients → matches nearest shop products → one-click cart fill.
- **Neo4j Graph Suggestions**: Products stored as graph nodes. When you buy pasta, the system records `BOUGHT_WITH` cheese → next user sees suggestion.
- **Intent-Aware Search**: Search "I have a cold" → AI returns Honey, Ginger Tea, Vitamin C.
- **AI Redundancy**: Complete fallback protocols for both Intent and Recipe agents, bypassing Gemini rate limit errors invisibly.

### Stage 3 — Orchestrator ✅
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Real card payments via Stripe test mode with inline Card Element. Supports COD fallback. Order summary shows subtotal, delivery fee (free above ₹500), and grand total.
- **Location Auto-Detect**: Integrates Nominatim Reverse Geocoding enabling auto-detecting user checkout delivery address.
- **Live Storeboard**: Real-time Socket.io dashboard showing top-selling products and top-rated shops.
- **Smart Cart Splitting**: Multi-shop orders auto-split per shop.
- **Product Detail Page**: Full product info with quantity selector and Neo4j-powered **Related Picks**.
- **Live Dynamic Filters**: Categories and Shops are fetched live from the database. Any new shop or category added by a seller is instantly reflected for all buyers.
- **Smart Shop Filter**: Selecting a specific shop overrides the "Nearby Only" proximity constraint, showing all products from that shop regardless of distance.
- **Smart Category Combobox**: Seller's category input features a searchable dropdown with live filtering and inline "+ Add new category" option.

### Bonus / God Mode ✅
- **Money Map**: Leaflet.js heatmap showing order density and intensity based on live MongoDB transactions.
- **Smart Product Pairing**: Hybrid engine using **Google Gemini** embeddings (3072-dim). It features a 3-tier fallback (Neo4j Graph -> Semantic Vector -> MongoDB Category) to ensure 100% availability with conceptual pairing.
- **Local First Geocoding**: Manual address fields on registration are automatically converted to coordinates via Nominatim fallback if GPS is not used.
- **Intelligent Barcode Inventory**: ZXing-powered barcode scanner for sellers. Features automated external API (OpenFoodFacts) lookup for unknown barcodes, a Fast Scan mode to rapidly restock existing items, and demo barcode generation.
- **Dynamic Product Constraints**: Real-time evaluation of perishable goods by introducing expiry dates on applicable categories.
- **Secure Developer Admin**: Secure Admin Panel (`/admin/users`) for full site surveillance.

### Stage 5 — Reliability & Fallbacks ✅
- **Instant Neo4j Fail-Fast**: Custom driver configurations detect sleeping AuraDB instances in 3 seconds to prevent API timeouts.
- **In-Memory Semantic Search**: If Neo4j is offline, vectors are queried from MongoDB and processed locally via an optimized Cosine Similarity Node.js function, ensuring 100% smart-pairing uptime without degrading into basic keyword search.
- **Hugging Face Inference**: Completely bypasses Gemini API rate limits (HTTP 429) by delegating NLP keyword extraction and intent parsing to Hugging Face's `Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` model on the fly.

### Stage 6 — Smart Logistics Preview ✅
- **Smart Delivery Route Visualization**: The cart sidebar now acts as a full logistics preview. When items span multiple shops it shows: optimized pickup order (nearest-neighbour algorithm), a horizontal flow bar (`Store A → Store B → Your Home`), per-stop summaries with item counts and ETA, and an interactive dark-themed Leaflet map with color-coded polylines (green = store-to-store, blue = last-mile delivery).
- **Multi-Model AI Fallback Router**: All Gemini text-generation calls go through `aiRouter.js` which automatically cycles through a configurable priority list (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gemini-3.0-flash → gemini-2.5-flash → gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) on rate-limit / quota errors. The last successful model is cached to reduce fallback switches. Every AI response includes a `modelUsed` field shown subtly in the UI.

### Stage 7 — Dynamic Ratings & Reviews ✅
- **Mongo-only review engine**: Added a dedicated `Review` collection for user feedback (`productId`, `shopId`, `userId`, `rating`, `reviewText`, timestamps).
- **Duplicate review prevention**: Unique compound index on `(userId, productId)` enforces one review per user per product.
- **Seed-preserving weighted product rating**: Added a dedicated `ProductRatingStat` collection to preserve baseline seeded ratings and blend real user reviews over time.
- **Weighted formula**:
    - `FinalProductRating = (SeedRating × SeedWeight + UserRatingSum) / (SeedWeight + UserReviewCount)`
    - Default `SeedWeight = 20`.
- **Dynamic shop rating from product ratings**:
    - `ShopRating = Σ(ProductFinalRating × ProductWeightedCount) / Σ(ProductWeightedCount)`
    - where `ProductWeightedCount = SeedWeight + UserReviewCount`.
- **Product detail review UX**:
    - Interactive 1–5 star selector with hover animation.
    - Optional review text with input length cap.
    - Sorting (`newest`, `highest`, `lowest`) and pagination.
    - Real-time summary display (`⭐ x.x / 5`, review count).

#### New Backend Files
- `backend/models/Review.js`
- `backend/models/ProductRatingStat.js`
- `backend/routes/reviews.js`

#### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/reviews/create`
    - Auth required.
    - Body: `{ productId, rating, reviewText? }`
    - Validates rating range and review length.
    - Prevents duplicate user reviews per product.
- `GET /api/reviews/product/:productId?sortBy=newest|highest|lowest&page=1&limit=6`
    - Returns weighted product rating summary + paginated reviews.
- `GET /api/reviews/shop/:shopId`
    - Returns dynamic shop rating derived from product-level weighted ratings.

#### Frontend Integration
- Updated `frontend/app/shop/[id]/page.tsx`:
    - Loads product rating summary from `/api/reviews/product/:productId`.
    - Loads dynamic shop rating from `/api/reviews/shop/:shopId`.
    - Allows authenticated users to submit a single review.
    - Renders review list with sorting and pagination controls.
- Updated `frontend/app/globals.css`:
    - Added review section visuals, star hover/fill animations, responsive review cards, and form styling.

#### Validation Rules
- User must be authenticated to create a review.
- Rating must be between 1 and 5.
- Review text maximum length is 600 characters.
- One review per user per product is enforced at both API and DB-index layers.

#### Verification Checklist
1. Open product page and confirm weighted rating summary renders.
2. Submit a new review while logged in and verify immediate summary update.
3. Attempt duplicate review for same product and verify API rejection.
4. Switch sort between newest/highest/lowest and verify order changes.
5. Use pagination controls and verify page transitions.
6. Confirm shop rating on product page reflects dynamic review-derived value.

## 🗺️ Geo-Spatial Location Engine

Smarter-Blinkit now features a pinpoint-accurate, interactive Map-Based Address Selection system powered by open-source technologies (Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap + Nominatim API). This completely replaces the legacy pincode-only system, optimizing downstream shop-distance routing.

### 1. Accurate Location Detection System
*   **Auto-Detection**: The browser's GeoLocation API automatically pinpoints the user on load.
*   **Draggable Pin**: Users can drag and drop the map marker to their exact doorstep. 
*   **Reverse Geocoding**: As the pin moves, the Nominatim API reverse-geocodes the coordinates into a human-readable street address, city, and pincode in real-time.

### 2. Map-Based Address Selection
*   **Interactive Search**: A debounced (500ms) search bar allows users to search for landmarks, buildings, or areas. Search results instantly fly the map to the selected coordinate.
*   **Recenter UX**: A floating "Use My Current Location" button allows users to quickly snap the map back to their GPS coordinates from anywhere in the world.
*   **GeoJSON Storage**: All locations are saved in strict `GeoJSON` format (`{ type: "Point", coordinates: [lng, lat] }`) to maximize MongoDB spatial query performance during checkout.

### 3. Updated 3-Step Registration Flow
Registration is now broken into a streamlined 3-step wizard:
1.  **General Details**: Name, Phone, Email, Role.
2.  **Location Selection**: Fullscreen interactive `MapPicker` to accurately acquire the initial delivery address.
3.  **Face ID Enrollment**: Frictionless biometric setup.

### 4. Saved Addresses Feature
*   **Address Book**: Buyers can save multiple delivery profiles (e.g., "Home", "Work", "Other") from their dashboard.
*   **Global Context**: The `active` address is broadcast across the app, instantly affecting Cart distances, AI Recipe filters, and Stripe checkout deliveries. Adding or editing an address launches the same standardized Map Picker interface.

## 🧠 AI Architecture & Fallbacks

The Smarter-Blinkit platform utilizes a multi-layered AI architecture to guarantee intelligent search results even when primary third-party services (Google, Neo4j) are disconnected, rate-limited, or asleep.

### 1. AI Intent Search (The Smart Search Bar)
*   **Goal:** Translates abstract user needs ("I have a cold", "movie night") into hyper-relevant product recommendations.
*   **Step 1: Concept Expansion (NLP)**
    *   **Primary:** Google Gemini (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`) expands the query into 5-6 grocery keywords (e.g., `["honey", "ginger tea", "cough syrup"]`).
    *   **Fallback:** Hugging Face Inference API (`Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`) takes over instantly if Gemini is unreachable or rate-limited.
*   **Step 2: Semantic Vector Match (Math)**
    *   **Primary:** Google Gemini (`gemini-embedding-001`) converts the query into a 3072-dimensional math vector. **Neo4j Graph Database** performs a lightning-fast nearest-neighbor Cosine Similarity search on its vector index to find conceptually related products.
    *   **Fallback (The "Fail-Fast" Engine):** If the Neo4j Aura free instance is paused, the connection intentionally fails within 3000ms. Node.js then fetches all 3072D embeddings directly from **MongoDB** and computes the Cosine Similarity locally in memory.
*   **Step 3: Keyword Fallback (Fail-Safe)**
    *   If embedding generation fails entirely (e.g., both Gemini and Hugging Face are blocked by a firewall), the system skips vector math and defaults to executing a highly optimized MongoDB Regex search using the expanded keywords from Step 1.

### 2. AI Recipe Agent (Meal Planner)
*   **Goal:** Converts recipe requests ("Make a pizza for 4 people") into a structured, ready-to-buy cart list.
*   **Step 1: JSON Ingredient Extraction**
    *   **Primary:** Google Gemini (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite` / `gemini-3.0-flash`) extracts ingredients, exact quantities, and optimized search parameters into a strict JSON array.
    *   **Fallback:** Hugging Face Inference API (`Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`) is invoked to extract the identical JSON structure if Gemini throws a 429 quota error.
*   **Step 2: Exact Product Matching**
    *   Unlike Intent Search (which looks for *concepts*), the Recipe Agent requires *exact* ingredients. It runs a direct **MongoDB Keyword Search** to find specific items like "Flour" or "Salt".
    *   If an exact match isn't found, it gently falls back to the local **Node.js Cosine Similarity** engine to find the closest available alternative in stock.
