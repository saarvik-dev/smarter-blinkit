## Known Issues / Technical Debt

| # | Issue | Severity | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cartIntelligenceService.js` calls `neo4jService.read()` which doesn't exist | 🔴 Runtime crash | `backend/services/cartIntelligenceService.js` |

| 3 | Password reset has no token verification (mock only) | 🟡 Security | `backend/routes/auth.js` |
| 4 | Socket.io has no authentication | 🟡 Security | `backend/sockets/storeboard.js` |
| 5 | Admin fallback secret hardcoded (`'smarter-dev-123'`) | 🟡 Security | `backend/routes/admin.js` |
| 6 | `userReportService` loads all records into memory | 🟡 Scalability | `backend/services/userReportService.js` |
| 7 | MoneyMap page loads Leaflet via script injection | 🟢 Cleanup | `frontend/app/money-map/page.tsx` |
| 8 | Frontend UI/UX refined to Market Ledger theme | 🟢 Resolved | All frontend files |

## Potential Next Tasks

- [ ] Fix `neo4jService.read()` missing function (Issue #1)
- [x] Improve frontend UI/UX — design, animations, responsiveness
- [ ] Add order status updates for sellers (confirm, prepare, dispatch, deliver)
- [x] Add product reviews and ratings from buyers
- [ ] Implement real email-based password reset (with token)
- [ ] Add Socket.io authentication
- [ ] Implement notification system (order updates, low stock alerts)
- [ ] Add seller analytics dashboard (sales charts, trends)
- [ ] Implement order tracking for buyers (real-time status)
- [ ] Add product image upload (currently URL-based or auto-fetched)
- [ ] Performance: optimize AI response times (Gemini/HuggingFace/Neo4j priority)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness across all pages

### Session — UI/UX Transformation
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Task:** Premium UI/UX transformation with Framer Motion animations

**Completed:**
- Installed `framer-motion` (v11) + `lenis` (smooth scroll)
- Created `frontend/lib/animations.ts` — central animation variant library (typed `Variants`)
- Created `frontend/components/SmoothScroll.tsx` — Lenis smooth scroll provider
- Created `frontend/app/template.tsx` — Next.js App Router page transitions
- Enhanced `frontend/app/globals.css` — 800+ lines of premium additions:
  - New CSS variables (glass effects, gradients, spring transitions)
  - Glassmorphism utility classes (`.glass-panel`, `.glass-input`, `.glass-card`)
  - Animated blob backgrounds (`.blob`, `.blob-green`, `.blob-blue`, `.blob-purple`)
  - AI-specific components (`.ai-thinking-dot`, `.ai-glow-ring`, `.ai-badge`)
  - Feature cards with hover overlay (`.feature-card`, `.feature-icon`)
  - Skeleton screens (`.skeleton-card`, `.skeleton-img`, `.skeleton-line`)
  - Premium button variants (`.btn-glow`, `.btn-gradient`)
  - Keyframes: `float`, `pulse-dot`, `gradient-shift`, `blob-move`, `glow-pulse`, `scan-line`
- Updated `frontend/app/layout.tsx` — SmoothScroll wrapper added
- Transformed `frontend/app/page.tsx` — hero with parallax blobs, mouse-tracked gradient, animated stats, floating ambient cards, staggered feature grid, motion-powered stages + CTA
- Transformed `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` — glassmorphism panel, animated background blobs, staggered form fields, glowing submit button
- Transformed `frontend/app/register/page.tsx` — AnimatePresence step transitions, animated step indicator with glow, role picker with hover animations, parallax background
- Transformed `frontend/components/Navbar.tsx` — slide-in on mount, logo hover scale
- Transformed `frontend/app/ai-agent/page.tsx` — AI glow ring header, animated thinking dots, glassmorphism input panel, staggered example prompts, AnimatePresence results
- Transformed `frontend/app/shop/page.tsx` — animated search hero, AnimatePresence for loading/empty/results states, animated thinking dots loader

**Architecture decisions:**
- All Framer Motion variants typed with `Variants` import — zero TypeScript errors
- Bezier easing stored as `[number, number, number, number]` tuple type
- All existing logic (API calls, state, handlers) left untouched — purely additive

## Agent Work Log

### Session — March 9, 2026 (Initial Setup)
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.6)  
**Task:** Deep project analysis + AI memory system setup

**Completed:**
- Full codebase analysis (backend: 4 models, 8 route files, 5 services, 1 middleware, 1 socket; frontend: 11 pages, 10 components, 1 context provider)
- Created `AGENT.md` with Quick Context, architecture decisions, rules, known issues
- Created `PROGRESS.md` with full feature tracker, issue log, and next tasks
- Catalogued all 44 API endpoints and their auth requirements
- Identified 8 known bugs/technical debt items

**Files Created:**
- `AGENT.md`
- `PROGRESS.md`

**Notes:**
- All 5 development stages are complete and functional
- Primary focus areas per README: AI response time optimization and frontend UI/UX improvement
- `cartIntelligenceService.js` has a broken contract with `neo4j.js` (missing `read()` method) — highest priority fix
